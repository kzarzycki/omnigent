"""Phase 0 characterization test — Ctrl+G debug overview toggle.

Submits one prompt so the session has at least one message,
hits ``Ctrl+G`` to open the debug overview, asserts the
sidebar + overview pane paints (``Session: main`` header +
``debug:`` footer hints), then hits ``q`` (which the REPL
binds alongside Esc in overview mode) to return to main mode
and asserts the normal status bar is back.

Tab/shift-tab cycling between multiple overview targets is
exercised by the sub-agent and terminal overview tests where
more than one target actually exists. With only the main
session, Tab wraps to itself and prompt-toolkit may suppress
the frame as a no-op redraw — so cycling is intentionally not
part of this test.

We use ``q`` rather than Esc for the close because prompt-
toolkit waits for the escape-sequence timeout (~100 ms) before
dispatching a bare Esc, which introduces flake risk; ``q`` is
an equivalent binding with immediate dispatch. The Esc binding
still ships and is exercised indirectly by the full keybinding
suite via ``@kb.add("escape", filter=overview_mode_filter)``.

**What breaks if this fails:**
- ``omnigent.cli`` removes or reorders the
  ``@kb.add("c-g")`` / overview-mode bindings.
- ``_collect_overview_targets`` stops producing a ``main``
  target, so the sidebar renders empty and the test's anchor
  disappears.
- ``_overview_footer_fragments`` changes its hint text so the
  footer-detection substring no longer matches.
- The ``Esc`` overview-mode binding stops returning the layout
  to main mode (the status bar wouldn't reappear).
