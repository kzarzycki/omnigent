"""Phase 0 characterization test — sub-agent visibility in overview.

Uses ``examples/coding_supervisor.yaml`` so the REPL hosts an
``openai-agents`` supervisor with ``claude_worker`` and
``codex_worker`` session-tools. Sends a prompt that explicitly
instructs the supervisor to use the chosen worker to print a
short message, waits for the sub-agent spawn to land in the
supervisor's tool stream, hits ``Ctrl+G``, cycles to the
sub-agent target with ``Tab``, and asserts the overview pane
renders ``Session ID:``, ``Executor:``, and ``Messages:`` lines
for the sub-agent. Parametrized so each wrapped harness
(claude-sdk, codex) is exercised as the sub-agent worker.

**What breaks if this fails:**
- The ``sys_session_send`` builtin's output JSON drops the
  ``conversation_id`` field — the REPL's overview target
  registration keys on it, so a missing ``conversation_id``
  produces a target with no session reference and an empty
  pane. **This test is specifically designed to catch that
  regression**: the ``Session ID:`` line comes from
  ``target.session.id`` which is None without a valid
  ``conversation_id``.
- ``_collect_overview_targets`` stops including managed agent
  sessions (``Session._agent_sessions``), so the sub-agent
  target is missing from the sidebar.
- ``_render_overview_managed_session_text`` regresses so the
  ``Executor:`` / ``Messages:`` metadata lines are dropped.
- The wrapped harness invocation inside the sub-agent fails
  (missing CLI, PAT profile invalid), so the worker never
  comes up and the overview never gets a second target.
