"""Phase 0 characterization test — terminal visibility in overview.

Uses ``examples/terminal_workers.yaml`` so the REPL hosts a
terminal-supervisor with ``worker`` and ``shell`` terminal
definitions. Sends a prompt that instructs the supervisor to
launch a terminal session, waits for the spawn to land,
opens the overview, cycles to the terminal target, and asserts
the overview pane renders the tmux ``attach`` instruction line.

**What breaks if this fails:**
- ``_collect_overview_targets`` stops including terminal
  instances from ``Session._terminal_instances``.
- ``_render_overview_terminal_text`` regresses so the
  ``Attach: tmux -S <socket> attach -t <target>`` line is
  dropped.
- ``_terminal_attach_command`` stops composing the
  ``tmux -S ... attach`` string correctly.
- The ``sys_terminal_launch`` tool path silently fails to
  register the instance in ``session._terminal_instances``.
