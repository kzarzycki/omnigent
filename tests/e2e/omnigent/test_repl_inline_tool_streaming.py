"""End-to-end coverage for inline tool-call + result streaming under
the Omnigent REPL with the ``claude-sdk`` harness.

Drives a real interactive REPL via the e2e pexpect harness against
``tests/resources/agents/sys-terminal-test/sys-terminal-test.yaml``
and asserts the user-visible ordering invariant:

    Each AP-side ``sys_terminal_*`` tool's call line AND its result
    panel appear BEFORE the agent's final assistant text —
    interleaved with the response, not bunched at end-of-turn.

Uses ``sys_terminal_launch`` (an AP-side built-in) — that's the
exact harness path the user hit. Three categories of tool
behavior under claude-sdk:

- **Built-in Bash**: handled inside the Claude SDK process. The
  harness adapter's ``ToolCallComplete`` branch emits a paired
  ``function_call_output`` SSE event INLINE as each Bash result
  lands, even without the inline-streaming fixes. Built-in tools don't
  exercise ``_dispatch_action_required``, so they don't catch the
  regression.
- **YAML function tools with `callable:`** (e.g. ``get_current_time``):
  registered as MCP tools in the SDK with a Python callback. The
  callback can short-circuit native — also doesn't go through
  ``_dispatch_action_required``.
- **AP-side built-ins** (``sys_terminal_*``, ``sys_session_*``):
  the SDK's MCP callback awaits ``ctx.dispatch_tool`` (action_required
  emission) → outer ``_dispatch_action_required`` runs the tool on
  the Omnigent server (where the terminal state lives) → PATCHes back.
  THIS is the path the inline ``function_call_output`` emit targets.
  Without the fix, every result panel bunches at the
  ``response.completed`` flush — exactly the user-reported bug
  (``sys_terminal_*`` calls in the databricks_coding_agent
  transcript).

**What breakage would surface here:**

- ``omnigent/runtime/harnesses/_client_executor.py:_translate_omnigent_event``
  reverts to buffering function_call events without yielding a
  :class:`ToolCallInProgress` — every ⏵ line then renders only at the
  ``response.completed`` flush, so all call lines appear AFTER any
  assistant text the LLM streamed alongside them. The "all ⏵ before
  Done." assertion below catches this.
- ``_dispatch_action_required`` stops emitting the inline
  ``response.output_item.done`` ``function_call_output`` event — every
  result panel then waits for the late ``ToolCallObserved`` flush, so
  result panels bunch at end-of-turn. The "result panels appear before
  Done. text" assertion catches this.
- ``omnigent_client._stream.BlockStream`` reverts to deferring
  ``ToolResultBlock`` yields until the next ``TextDelta`` /
  ``ResponseCreated`` — same end-of-turn bunching even if the SSE
  events arrive inline. The same assertions catch this.
- The new ``seen_call_ids`` / ``seen_result_call_ids`` dedupes regress
  to clearing on ``TextDelta`` — duplicate ⏵ or result-panel renders
  surface as the per-tool counts going above 1.

Test integrity:

The iron-rule audit walked through reverting each of those production
changes individually and confirmed the corresponding assertion below
fails loud. See the inline tool-streaming notes in
``designs/RUN_OMNIGENT_REPL_PARITY.md``.

Why claude-sdk specifically:

The bug surfaced under the claude-sdk harness because that's the path
where every spec-declared tool round-trips through the AP-side
``the harness HTTP client._dispatch_action_required`` pipeline. ``codex``
and ``pi`` use the same code path, so this single-harness test pins
the contract for all three. Adding the matrix would burn 3x CI time
without distinguishing coverage.
